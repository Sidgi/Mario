Game Name is Mario .

When Mario gets 1000 points he weens
He should go over lava and his main enemy "boo".
Boo is flying accross the canvas and when he touches the mario, mario will loose 100pts, Mario will loose if score will deacres to 0 and "Boo" will touch  
Mario gets points by eating the conins. When Mario touches the coin, coin will disappear and Mario will get points. 
Mario can jump on breek and grab the coins 
Each time Mario grabs the coin it will add 50 pts to his score. As I mentioned above he will win when he will reach 1000 pts.
Mario even can strike the "boo" but each strike will take 50 pts from him.
Mario can't go over the board. P.s. I want to try to restrict for him to go left but if he goes right canvas will repaint again. But breeks will appear in different place


Difficulties 
1) Gravitation . Recreate gravitation
2) Link keys on keyaboard with actions: 

a) Arrow right goes right, 
b) arrow left goes left, 
c) if press space it jumps
d) if press 'q' it will strike in enemies - 'boo's

3) update the score each time Mario touches the coin (add 50 pts) or strikes (deacreses 50 pts) and each time boo will touch the mario score will deacrease on 100pts.

4) Collision detection :
a) Mario with "boo"
b) Mario with coins
c) Mario with boards
d) Mario with breaks 
e) Mario with cloud

4) Ps optional if I will have time I will make lava and if Mario will fall into it he will lose no matter how many points he has   

Technologies: 

1) I will use the browser and the DOM to display
2) Reading keyboard keys
3) Motion and collision
4) Gravity
5) Canvas

I am planning to foresee the problem with reading books eloiqueant js, Youtube and Google, and MDN.
